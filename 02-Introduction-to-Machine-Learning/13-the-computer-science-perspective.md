The Computer Science Perspective
================================

Computer science terminology
----------------------------

As we discussed earlier, one of the simplest ways we can organize data for machine learning is in a table, like the table of clothing products we looked at earlier in this lesson:

|SKU|Make|Color|Quantity|Price|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|908721|Guess|Blue|789|45.33|
|456552|Tillys|Red|244|22.91|
|789921|A&F|Green|387|25.92|
|872266|Guess|Blue|154|17.56|


What are some of the terms we can use to describe this data?

For the **rows** in the table, we might call each row an **entity** or an **observation** about an entity. In our example above, each _entity_ is simply a product, and when we speak of an _observation_, we are simply referring to the data collected about a given product. You'll also sometimes see a row of data referred to as an **instance**, in the sense that a row may be considered a single example (or instance) of data.

For the **columns** in the table, we might refer to each column as a **feature** or **attribute** which describes the property of an entity. In the above example, `color` and `quantity` are _features_ (or _attributes_) of the products.

Input and output
----------------

Remember that in a typical case of machine learning, you have some kind of _input_ which you feed into the machine learning algorithm, and the algorithm produces some _output._ In most cases, there are multiple pieces of data being used as input. For example, we can think of a single row from the above table as a _vector_ of data points:

    (908721, Guess, Blue, 789, 45.33)
    

Again, in computer science terminology, each element of the input vector (such as `Guess` or `Blue`) is referred to as an _attribute_ or _feature_. Thus, we might feed these _input features_ into our machine learning program and the program would then generate some kind of desired output (such as a prediction about how well the product will sell). This can be represented as:

    Output = Program(Input Features)
    

An important step in preparing your data for machine learning is _extracting_ the relevant features from the raw data. (The topic of _feature extraction_ is an important one that we'll dive into in greater detail in a later lesson.)

### Question 1 of 2

Have a look at this data:

| ID  | Name   | Species | Age |
| --- | ---    | ---     | --- |
| 1   | Jake   | Cat     | 3   |
| 2   | Bailey | Dog     | 7   |
| 3   | Jenna  | Dog     | 4   |
| 4   | Marco  | Cat     | 12  |


Which of the following terms might we use to refer to the part of the table that is highlighted?

(Select all that apply.)

- [x] A _row_
- [ ] An _attribute_
- [x] An _entity_
- [x] An _instance_
- [x] An _input vector_
- [ ] A _feature_
    
> Remember, another term we can use to refer to a row of data is entity. In this example, each row gives the data about an animal.

> Remember, another term we can use to refer to a row of data is an instance. In this example, we can think of each row as an instance of an animal (a dog or a cat).

> Remember, we can also think of each row of data as an input vectorâ€”a list of data points that we can use as input for the machine learning model.

| 2   | Bailey | Dog         | 7   |
| 3   | Jenna  | Dog         | 4   |
| 4   | Marco  | Cat         | 12  |

Which of the following terms might we use to refer to the part of the table that is highlighted?

(Select all that apply.)

- [x] A _column_
- [x] An _attribute_
- [ ] An _entity_
- [ ] An _instance_
- [x] A _feature_
