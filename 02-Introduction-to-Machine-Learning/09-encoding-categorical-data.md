Encoding Categorical Data
=========================

As we've mentioned a few times now, machine learning algorithms need to have data in numerical form. Thus, when we have _categorical_ data, we need to encode it in some way so that it is represented numerically.

There are two common approaches for encoding categorical data: **ordinal encoding** and **one hot encoding**.

Ordinal Encoding
----------------

In **ordinal encoding**, we simply convert the categorical data into integer codes ranging from `0` to `(number of categories â€“ 1)`. Let's look again at our example table of clothing products:

| SKU    | Make   | Color | Quantity | Price |
| ---    | ---    | ---   | ---      | ---   |
| 908721 | Guess  | Blue  | 789      | 45.33 |
| 456552 | Tillys | Red   | 244      | 22.91 |
| 789921 | A&F    | Green | 387      | 25.92 |
| 872266 | Guess  | Blue  | 154      | 17.56 |


If we apply ordinal encoding to the `Make` property, we get the following:

| Make   | Encoding |
| ---    | ---      |
| A&F    | 0        |
| Guess  | 1        |
| Tillys | 2        |


And if we apply it to the Color property, we get:

| Color | Encoding |
| ---   | ---      |
| Red   | 0        |
| Green | 1        |
| Blue  | 2        |


Using the above encoding, the transformed table is shown below:

| SKU    | Make | Color | Quantity | Price |
| ---    | ---  | ---   | ---      | ---   |
| 908721 | 1    | 2     | 789      | 45.33 |
| 456552 | 2    | 0     | 244      | 22.91 |
| 789921 | 0    | 1     | 387      | 25.92 |
| 872266 | 1    | 2     | 154      | 17.56 |


One of the potential drawbacks to this approach is that it implicitly assumes an order across the categories. In the above example, `Blue` (which is encoded with a value of `2`) seems to be _more_ than `Red` (which is encoded with a value of `1`), even though this is in fact not a meaningful way of comparing those values. This is not _necessarily_ a problem, but it is a reason to be cautious in terms of how the encoded data is used.

One-Hot Encoding
----------------

**One-hot encoding** is a very different approach. In one-hot encoding, we transform each categorical value into a column. If there are `n` categorical values, `n` new columns are added. For example, the `Color` property has three categorical values: `Red`, `Green`, and `Blue`, so three new columns `Red`, `Green`, and `Blue` are added.

If an item belongs to a category, the column representing that category gets the value `1`, and all other columns get the value `0`. For example, item 908721 (first row in the table) has the color blue, so we put `1` into that `Blue` column for 908721 and `0` into the `Red` and `Green` columns. Item 456552 (second row in the table) has color red, so we put `1` into that `Red` column for 456552 and `0` into the `Green` and `Blue` columns.

If we do the same thing for the `Make` property, our table can be transformed as follows:

| SKU    | A&F | Guess | Tillys | Red | Green | Blue | Quantity | Price |
| ---    | --- | ---   | ---    | --- | ---   | ---  | ---      | ---   |
| 908721 | 0   | 1     | 0      | 0   | 0     | 1    | 789      | 45.33 |
| 456552 | 0   | 0     | 1      | 1   | 0     | 0    | 244      | 22.91 |
| 789921 | 1   | 0     | 0      | 0   | 1     | 0    | 387      | 25.92 |
| 872266 | 0   | 1     | 0      | 0   | 0     | 1    | 154      | 17.56 |


One drawback of one-hot encoding is that it can potentially generate a very large number of columns.

Have a look at this tabular data:

| ID  | Mammal | Reptile | Fish |
| --- | ---    | ---     | ---  |
| 012 | 1      | 0       | 0    |
| 204 | 0      | 0       | 1    |
| 009 | 0      | 1       | 0    |
| 105 | 1      | 0       | 0    |

### Question 3 of 4

Again looking at the above animals table, suppose we do the following:

1.  Add two new categories, `Amphibian` and `Bird`
2.  Add one bird with ID `303` in the table

Which one of the following statements is correct about the new table?

*   There are 5 columns in the new table including the `ID` column
    
*   Animal `303` has `1` in the `Mammal` column
    
*   The `Amphibian` column has `0` for all animals
    
*   Animal `303` has `0` in the `Bird` column
