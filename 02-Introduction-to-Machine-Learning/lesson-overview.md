# Lesson Overview

In this lesson, our goal is to give you a high-level introduction to the field of machine learning, including the broader context in which this branch of computer science exists.

Here are the main topics we'll cover:

*   What machine learning is and why it's so important in today's world
*   The historical context of machine learning
*   The data science process
*   The types of data that machine learning deals with
*   The two main perspectives in ML: the _statistical_ perspective and the _computer science_ perspective
*   The essential tools needed for designing and training machine learning models
*   The basics of Azure ML
*   The distinction between models and algorithms
*   The basics of a linear regression model
*   The distinction between parametric vs. non-parametric functions
*   The distinction between classical machine learning vs. deep learning
*   The main approaches to machine learning
*   The trade-offs that come up when making decisions about how to design and training machine learning models

In the process, you will also train your first machine learning model using Azure Machine Learning Studio.
